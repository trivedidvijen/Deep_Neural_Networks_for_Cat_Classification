# Deep Neural Networks for Cat Classification

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the online course [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/75XL2A4QXF2V) on Coursera from Mar - Apr 2017. It is part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

Course Instructor: [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)

## Methods

This project is mainly split into two parts:

1. Building Deep Neural Network - Set of helper functions for both 2-layer and L-layer classifier, later used for building the cat classifier 
2. Deep Neural Network Application - Using the previously developed helper functions a cat classification application is developed, using both 2-Layer and L-layer models

## Conclusion

Testing accuracy increases from $72\%$ to $80\%$ while going from 2-Layer (Shallow) to 4-layer (Deep) Neural Networks for cat classification.

A few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include:

- Cat body in an unusual position
- Cat appears against a background of a similar color
- Unusual cat color and species
- Camera Angle
- Brightness of the picture
- Scale variation (cat is very large or small in image)
